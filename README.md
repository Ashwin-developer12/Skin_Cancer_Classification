# Skin_Cancer_Classification
It is a repo with the skin cancer classification using cnn<br>
I've collected the dataset from kaggle, its a ham10000 images dataset, containing 7 classes of skin cancer<br>
I've used keras in tensorflow to create a CNN model to classify the images into 7 classes<br>
All the images are present in the 28 by 28 rgb images <br>
The CNN contains 7 convolutional layers along with 5 maxpooling layers<br>
Atlast 2 fully connected layers<br>
then the final layer with softmax activation
